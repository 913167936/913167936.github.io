### 360 image
This is the first project I started in my 10th grade year.  We went out as a group and used a 360 camera to take a few pictures.  We then uploaded them to the computer and used vizo to share them to my website.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/913167936/913167936.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
